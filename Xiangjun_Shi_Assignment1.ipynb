    "Electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has provided customers in the modern digital age with numerous social media outlets to discuss a company's products and services. Thus, eWOM has arisen as a significant aspect in developing a company's attractiveness and reputation within its target audience, highlighting the significance of media reputation monitoring (Park & Lee, 2009). As one of the world's largest online retailers, Amazon has established a significant social media presence, including Twitter. However, managing eWOM, particularly negative sentiment, has posed significant communication challenges for Amazon on the platform. By publishing reviews and tweets, customers actively participate in the co-construction of media reputations, exposing millions of people to assessments made by their peers and other actors (Etter et al., 2019). Due to Twitter's viral nature, negative sentiment can spread quickly, potentially causing damage to Amazon's brand reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research aims to explore the relationship between sentiment and tweet popularity on Twitter. The guiding research question is, \"To what extent does sentiment affect the popularity of tweets on Twitter?\" Through a research analysis, the study intends to identify any patterns or trends that may exist in the relationship between sentiment and tweet popularity. Amazon's prominence and popularity on Twitter make it a relevant subject for this research. Therefore, Amazon's experiences in managing sentiment on Twitter can offer valuable insights into effective communication management on social media.\n"

    "The theory of emotional contagion suggests that emotional contagion is a form of social influence that can occur both subconsciously and consciously (Barsade, 2002). Individuals tend to share content that elicits strong emotional responses because they want to share those feelings with others, resulting in a greater spread of emotional content compared to informative content, leading to a ripple effect in which the emotional state of individuals can influence the emotional state of others (Barsade, 2002). Additionally, selective processing and attention play a crucial role in the spread of emotional content. According to Etter et al. (2019), emotionally charged content, such as fun, happiness, wrath, fear, contempt, or surprise, is preferentially processed and attended to, resulting in increased memory retention and the selective accessibility of information. This heightened emotional arousal provides an excitatory condition that motivates people to share information, resulting in a greater spread of emotional content online and offline (Etter et al., 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings are relevant to the news value theory, which offers a comprehensive set of news characteristics for journalists to decide what to consider as news in the face of an abundance of events but limited outlet space and time (Galtung & Ruge, 1965). Araujo and van der Meer (2020) noted that in a hybrid news system, users also use similar selection criteria to determine the relevance of information, and news value can be used to predict the popularity of a topic by measuring public engagement (e.g., sharing, liking, and commenting on the content). Additionally, valence, which indicates the positivity or negativity of a topic, can attract more online attention for organizations (Araujo & van der Meer, 2020) . However, not all emotions carry the same weight according to the negativity bias theory. The negativity bias is a cognitive bias that suggests that humans are more sensitive to negative stimuli than positive stimuli (Vaish, Grossmann & Woodward, 2008). This bias indicates that negative events or emotions have a greater influence on us than positive ones. In the context of content sharing, the negativity bias suggests that negative content is more likely to elicit a strong emotional response and is, as a result, more likely to be shared than positive content; leading to the hypothesis that tweets with a higher negative sentiment score will result in more retweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the amount of followers a user has, as well as the promotional tweets distributed by Amazon, can have a major impact on the likelihood of content being retweeted due to its greater reach and extensive marketing, and therefore their content is more likely to reach a larger audience. Based on this understanding, number of followers and promotional tweets will be controlled in the analysis to assess their impact on retweets."

    "## Gathering Data \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cells below you should load the dataset(s) into pandas to begin the data understanding and preparation. It is important to provide the reader with sufficient information to understand how the data were collected, and what the dataset is about. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, you should answer at least adress the following topics in this section:\n",
    "* What is the dataset about? How does it relate to the business challenge?\n",
    "* What is the source of the data? \n",
    "    * If the data came from API's (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, YouTube) or specific tools (e.g., Google Analytics), this should be mentioned.\n",
    "    * If specific tools were used (e.g., DMI-TCAT for collecting Twitter data, or SentiStrength for sentiment analysis), they should also be mentioned (and the appropriate papers cited).\n",
    "* How were the data collected? What type of data collection (and/or sampling) strategy was used, and why? \n",
    "* The dataset is applicable to what time period? Why?\n",
    "* What are the potential biases that could be introduced in the dataset because of the data collection method?\n",
    "* How was privacy taken in consideration during data collection? What are some of the risks and/or privacy trade-offs that should be considered?\n",
    "\n",
    "For our assignment, if the dataset contains simulated data, we expect you to also include:\n",
    "* A clear disclaimer that this is a simulated dataset\n",
    "* A brief explanation of how the dataset was simulated\n",
    "* Important: the explanations and discussions should be written as if the dataset were real (i.e., indicating that “there are no privacy concerns because the dataset is simulated” is not acceptable).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a tip: use a meaningful name for your dataset(s) when loading them into a Pandas dataframe. Calling them just *df* or *data* will become confusing later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** As part of open science and replicability, it is important to indicate also to the reader where the data is stored or located. In the case of Assignment 1, we expect you to upload the dataset to our SurfDrive folder, so we can download the data and replicate your results.\n"

    "## Gathering Data \n",
    "This Amazon-focused study examined Twitter sentiment and engagement using two datasets. The first Twitter API dataset included tweets, public metrics, and user data. Users' tweets and public metrics like impressions, retweets, and likes were needed to answer the research question about sentiment and engagement. This dataset collected data in 2023, as requested. Although the time period is not directly related to the topic of the study, the most recent data can provide more current insights to validate previous hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset was a sentiment dataset that provided sentiment scores ranging from -5 to 5, sourced from SentiStrength for sentiment analysis. The sentiment dataset included an ID and its corresponding sentiment score, indicating whether the tweet expressed a positive or negative sentiment.The sentiment dataset was essential to investigate the relationship between sentiment and engagement on Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is essential to consider potential biases related to the collection method. According to Possler (2019), API data provides structured, clean data with accurate metadata, while it requires intensive data cleansing and may lack additional information. Sampling and data completeness also need to be taken into account since API providers limit the amount of data that can be downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment scores used in sentiment analysis are arbitrary and may not accurately represent real sentiment dynamics, highlighting the importance of reliability tests. Irony and other forms of figurative language can be particularly challenging for sentiment analysis models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the Twitter dataset includes various user information, such as usernames and opinions about Amazon, which may enable inferences or predictions about individuals and be used for other purposes, such as targeted advertising. Therefore, the dataset needs to be minimized, and usernames pseudonymized to ensure privacy and ethical considerations.\n"

    "* You need to communicate your steps clearly to the reader. This means that you should not just do a *df.describe()*  to communicate descriptive statistics in a dataset that contains a lot of irrelevant columns and expect the reader to figure out by her or himself what is relevant. You should instead only show to the reader what is relevant, and explain why.\n",

    "## Data Exploration & Evaluation\n",
    "This analysis employs a merged dataset that incorporates all relevant variables required for further analysis. The independent variable in this study is the overall sentiment score of tweets, which is a composite variable that combines the positive, neutral, and negative sentiment scores of each tweet. This variable ranges from -5 to 5, with higher scores indicating a more favorable attitude. The dataset's mean score is 0.382, with a standard deviation of 1.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis focuses on the number of retweets, which serves as an indicator of a tweet's popularity and virality. The dependent variable ranges continuously from 0 to 17661, with an average of 131.565. However, the standard deviation of 863.357 indicates that a small proportion of tweets have an overwhelmingly high number of retweets, contributing to data imbalance. In fact, 75% of the tweets have a value of 5 or less, while the highest recorded value is 17661.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that a similarly high standard deviation of 238959.125 is observed for the control variable \"metric followers count,\" with 75% of users have more than 5497 followers. This data imbalance could also potentially skew the results of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of data selection is subject to a certain degree of bias, as it is often difficult to predict or control the timing of data collection in relation to external factors such as promotional offerings by Amazon. Consequently, current data sets contains a disproportionately large number of promotional tweets, with nearly one quarter of the tweets related to promotions. This presents a potential challenge for analyzing data in a  unbiased manner, as the presence of promotional tweets may have a huge impact on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the accuracy of the sentiment score coding, inter-coder reliability was assessed using the Krippendorff's alpha reliability test. The test revealed a poor reliability score of -0.095, indicating that there was less agreement than expected by chance between the human coder's sentiment score and the SentiStrength program. Therefore, additional research is required to identify the sources of disagreement and determine the optimal method for improving the coding scheme's reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, after analyzing the dataset's visualizations, it was discovered that nearly half of the tweets in the dataset had a neutral sentiment score, and neutral tweets were retweeted more frequently than positive or negative tweets. Therefore, it is possible that the evidence does not support Hypothesis 1, which proposes that the likelihood of a tweet being retweeted increases as the sentiment score decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the results of this analysis suggest that the sentiment score of a tweet may not be the sole factor driving its retweetability. \n",

    "## Modeling and Hypothesis Testing \n",
    "\n",
    "After understanding and preparing the data, you are ready to do the modeling. It is important to explain to the reader:\n",
    "* Explaining which models will be used, and why\n",
    "* If appropriate, explaining which strategy you are using to fine tune or improve the model\n",
    "* Discussion about the model evaluation (i.e., why you believe the model is a good model) and, if appropriate, comparison between different models\n",
    "* After the appropriate model is identified, then the hypothesis can be tested. You can then report the result of the tests being used to test the hypothesis (as discussed in the criteria for the assignment), explaining to the reader how the test is being made and what the results of the testing mean for the hypothesis at hand. \n",
    "* Visualizations (as appropriate) are helpful to explain to the reader what has been found.\n",
    "* Usage of the model to make predictions (e.g., key audience segments)\n",
    "* Reviewing the model to indicate which features (variables) are responsible for the predictions (related to Explainable AI discussions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:**\n",
    "* We consider as different models both when different features/variables are being tested (to achieve the same objective), or when different algorithms are being tested (with the same features/IVs)\n",
    "* It is important to explain to the reader what the model contains/is, and also how it is being evaluated. When the evaluation is done, it is also important to discuss what the result means in the current context\n",
    "* As the focus of this course is on predictive analytics, it is expected that predictions are made (using scikit-learn) and discussed after a hypothesis is tested. This means that when ANOVAs or T-Tests are used (as statistical testing), and equivalent OLS/Linear Regression Model (in scikit-learn) needs to be used to make predictions. All tests need to be done in Python, using statsmodels and/or scikit-learn."

    "An ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between retweet count (metric_retweet_count) and overall sentiment score (overall_sent), controlling for number of followers (metric_followers_count) and promotion. The sample consisted of 6,297 observations. The overall model was statistically significant, F(3, 6293) = 5.02, p = .002, and accounted for a small but significant amount of the variance in retweet count, R2 = .00. Of the three predictor variables, only promotion (β = 88.86, t = 3.411, p = .001, 95% CI [37.79, 139.93]) was found to have a significant relationship with retweet count. The regression coefficient for overall sentiment score (β = 10.41, t = 1.627, p > .05, 95% CI [-2.13, 22.96]) and number of followers (β = 0.00, t = -0.446, p > .05, 95% CI [-0.00, 6.89]) were not statistically significant.\n",

    "This means hypothesis that proposes the likelihood of a tweet being retweeted increases as the sentiment score decreases is not supported. Moreover,control variable promotion had a significant positive relationship with retweet count, while overall sentiment score and number of followers were not significantly related to retweet count. Specifically, the regression coefficient for promotion indicates that for each unit increase in promotion, retweet count increased by 88.86 units on average. The small R2 value indicates that the model accounts for only a small amount of the variance in retweet count. It is important to note that while the results were statistically significant, the effect size for promotion was relatively small, suggesting that other factors beyond those included in the model may also play a role in predicting retweet count."

    "The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between the sentiment of tweets and their retweetability, and to explore the factors that influence the likelihood of a tweet being retweeted on Twitter. The results of the regression analysis indicated that the hypothesis that the likelihood of a tweet being retweeted increases as the sentiment score decreases is not supported by the data. In other words, positive sentiment does not necessarily increase retweetability, nor does negative sentiment decrease it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis revealed that promotion-related tweets are associated with higher retweet counts, indicating that promotional content is more likely to be shared among Twitter users than other types of content. However, the model's small R2 value suggests that the analysis only accounts for a small portion of the variance in retweet counts. Surprisingly, having more followers does not necessarily result in more retweets, contrary to expectations.\n",

    "These results have significant implications for Amazon's social media management and monitoring on Twitter. Firstly, the findings indicate that neither positive nor negative electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in the form of (re)tweets influences the likelihood of it being spread to more people. Therefore, there is no strong evidence that negative sentiment or sentiment in general will become systematically viral on Twitter and pose a threat to Amazon's media reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the analysis found that sentiment did not have a significant effect on retweetability, it is still important for Amazon to monitor sentiment trends on social media. This can help the company identify potential issues or concerns that customers may have and respond to them in a timely and appropriate manner. It can also help the company identify opportunities to improve its products or services based on customer feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that promotion-related tweets are associated with higher retweet counts suggests that Amazon should consider including more promotional content in their social media strategy. By doing so, they may increase the likelihood that their content will be shared among Twitter users, which can help to increase brand awareness and drive sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Amazon may consider diversifying its tweets beyond the 'promotion' theme. For instance, in addition to promotional tweets, the company could post tweets that are informative, educational, or entertaining. This has the potential to raise the level of engagement with followers, which in turn may increase the number of retweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is essential to note that the model only accounts for a small portion of the variance in retweet counts, and there may be other factors that influence the likelihood of a tweet being retweeted on Twitter. Therefore, Amazon should continue to monitor and analyze their social media activity on Twitter to identify and understand these factors and adjust their social media strategy accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this research provides new insights into the retweetability of tweets and has real-world applications for Amazon's handling of its social media presence on Twitter. Taking these results into account and continuing to monitor Twitter social media activity, Amazon can boost brand recognition and positive eWOM. "

    "This section discusses the limitations of the study, including data limitations, decisions regarding data comprehension and preparation, and model and hypothesis testing limitations. Alternative interpretations will also be considered, and solutions to the most significant limitations will be proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, using SentiStrength to evaluate the sentiment of the independent variable may compromise the internal validity of the study.Thelwall et al., (2012) state that sentiment analysis arbitrarily assigns a weight or valence to each word within a tweet, regardless of its context. A tweet may contain the word \"love,\" which carries a positive sentiment weight of 4, but it refers implies a neutral sentiment as it is the title of a book. Limited Twitter API access may also affect sentiment analysis accuracy because human coders may not be able to see the full tweet text to assign accurate sentiment score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study's second limitation lies in the unbalanced nature of the data. Most tweets receive only a few retweets, and a few receive a disproportionate number. This imbalance could distort the analysis, as shown by the standard deviation of 863.357 for 75% of tweets having a value of 5 or less. Similarly, the control variable \"metric followers count\" shows a similar imbalance, with 75% of users having over 5497 followers and a standard deviation of 238959.125. An unbalanced dataset could undermine the analysis's reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, there is a limitation on the use of NLP-related techniques to generate the controlled categorical variable \"promotion.\" In light of the fact that it is up to the researcher to determine which keywords in a tweet serve as indicators of promotional intent. Promotional tweets containing only the product name maybe be ignored. Additionally, some users may inadvertently use such terms, which may be misrepresented as promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With an R-square of 0.002, the prediction model is statistically significant but weak. This indicates that the model cannot account for a substantial portion of the variance in the data and that other variables may influence the dependent variable. Different interpretations of the results must be considered. For example, the fact that promotional tweets make up a disproportionately large portion of the data set might suggest that people prefer to retweet these messages. Consequently, it is possible that other factors are more important than the model's predictability in determining the likelihood that a tweet will be retweeted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research may investigate non-linear modeling methods to improve model prediction in order to address these limitations. Using more complex models, such as decision trees, may capture nonlinear relationships between variables more accurately. In addition, examining additional independent variables beyond sentiment, follower count, and promotion may result in a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that affect the retweetability of tweets."

    "Incorporating Twitter data into social media monitoring or media reputation management can raise ethical concerns for Amazon. To prevent potential violations of user privacy, Amazon must be careful when using data gathered from Twitter for political or commercial purposes. By conducting sentiment analysis of Twitter data, Amazon can gain insights into users' preferences and impressions from their tweets. This information can then be used by Amazon and other companies to create personalized prediction products that anticipate users' future behavior (Zuboff, 2020). However, if this data is used without the user's knowledge or consent, it could be considered a breach of their privacy. In particular, third parties may use this information to target users with targeted advertising or other content designed to sway their decisions. (Saltz & Dewar, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial for individuals to be aware of the potential repercussions of utilizing old data sets for new purposes, as data can now be manipulated in ways that were unforeseeable to the original data creators (Tucker, 2019). In Amazon's case, there is a possibility that their actions could have unintended outcomes that could harm both individuals and society as a whole. For instance, if their analysis indicates that tweets with negative sentiments or promotional content are more likely to become viral, individuals or organizations might attempt to manipulate tweet content to increase their popularity and gain attention. Overusing negative content or false promotions could result in a surge of misinformation with unpredictable consequences for individuals' ability to make informed decisions and the overall positive climate of information sharing in society (Jahng et al., 2020; Kozyreva et al., 2020).\n",
